======================================
Musical Intelligence Report — ONE Gemini call, maximum value.

Gemini receives the raw BGM audio file PLUS two grounding-context blocks —
machine-computed beat/tempo math and a word-level ASR transcript — and returns
a full structured intelligence report that drives ALL downstream rhythm
editing decisions:

    1. Lyric timestamps + emotional weight per word/phrase
    2. Section map   (intro / verse / pre-chorus / chorus / drop / bridge / outro)
    3. Tension arc   (0-1 score per second — drives hold vs. cut decisions)
    4. Shot directives (what visual to use at which moment)
    5. Vibe tags     (feeds CreativeBrain niche alignment)
    6. Emotional peak moments (single timestamps for instant-cut triggers)

Why ONE call? Because all 6 outputs share the same audio context window —
splitting them into 6 calls would cost 6x the quota for the same source material.

Controlled by: ENABLE_LYRIC_SYNC=true (default: true)
Gracefully returns empty structure on failure / instrumental audio.

CHANGELOG (fusion-precision rewrite)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This revision fixes a gap between intent and implementation: the module was
computing beat/tempo math (STEP 1) and running faster-whisper (STEP 2), but
the math was NEVER included in the Gemini prompt — it was only spliced into
the output *after* Gemini had already responded blind. Only sentence-level
(not word-level) ASR text was passed in, capped at 25 lines. The Gemini call
also had a hard 15s wall-clock timeout that guarantees fallback on any real
audio-understanding + large-JSON-generation task, which was almost certainly
the dominant cause of low output quality, not model capability.

Fixed in this version:
  - Math (BPM, beat grid, drop timestamps) is now serialized into the prompt
    as an explicit grounding block, not merged post-hoc.
  - Word-level ASR timestamps (not sentence-capped-at-25) are passed in,
    reused from the Phase-1 speech_boundaries.json when it already exists
    instead of re-running faster-whisper a second time.
  - Gemini call timeout raised to a realistic, configurable default.
  - Fixed a NameError in the upload-cleanup `finally:` block that silently
    caused every uploaded file to leak (never actually deleted).
  - Removed the blind "quote unquoted keys" regex JSON repair, which could
    corrupt lyric text containing colons. Replaced with structural-only
    cleanup + optional `json_repair` library as a verified last resort.
  - Cached / pooled results are stamped with a prompt version so upgrading
    this module doesn't get masked by stale results forever.

_PROMPT = """You are a world-class music supervisor and video editor with expertise in rhythm-based editing.

Listen to this audio track carefully. Extract EVERYTHING needed to edit a viral short-form video to this music.

You will also be given two machine-computed grounding-context blocks after this prompt:
  1. BEAT/TEMPO DATA — exact BPM, beat timestamps, and drop timestamps computed mathematically from
     the waveform. Treat this as ground truth for timing/rhythm; use it to sanity-check your own
     tension_arc and recommended_cut_pace values, not to override what you actually hear.
  2. ASR TRANSCRIPT REFERENCE — a word-level (or sentence-level, if word-level wasn't available)
     speech-to-text transcript with timestamps. This is machine-generated and WILL contain misheard
     words, especially for regional languages, slang, or ad-libs. Treat its TIMESTAMPS as reliable
     timing anchors for where vocals occur, but treat its WORDS only as a hint — correct the actual
     wording yourself by listening to the audio.

RULES:
- WHISPER ROLE (RELY ONLY ON TIMESTAMPS, NOT WHISPER TEXT):
  Faster-Whisper text (`asr_raw`) frequently mishears regional, Hindi, or song lyrics into wrong English words.
  DO NOT rely on Whisper's text for spelling or word accuracy. RELY ONLY ON WHISPER'S PCM TIMESTAMPS (`time` and `end`) as precision timing anchors.
  Listen directly to the uploaded raw audio track to extract the true spoken/sung words for `lyrics[].text` and `transcript`.

- transcript (EXHAUSTIVE 100% FULL-TRACK SPEECH COVERAGE):
  Provide the 100% complete, verbatim continuous speech/lyric transcript covering the ENTIRE audio track from 0.0s to the end of the audio file.
  Listen to the uploaded raw audio track across its FULL duration. Do NOT stop transcribing early even if the ASR reference block below has gaps.
  Do NOT summarize, skip, or truncate ANY spoken or sung words.
  If instrumental or no speech, set to "".

- is_unusable: set to true ONLY if the audio is unusable non-music noise (e.g. crowd chatter, shouting, car traffic noise, stock market trading hall shouting, heavy static/distortion with no usable music).

- lyrics TIMESTAMP LOCK (CRITICAL — highest priority rule):
  The `time` and `end` values in every lyrics[] entry MUST be copied verbatim from the ASR transcript
  timestamps provided below. You are FORBIDDEN from changing, rounding, shifting, or estimating these
  values. The ASR timestamps are PCM-measured — they are more accurate than anything you can infer.
  Your primary job on each lyrics entry is to determine the TRUE words in `text` by listening directly to the raw audio track at that timestamp.
  If you hear a vocal that has NO corresponding ASR timestamp, add new lyrics entries using the nearest beat timestamp from the BEAT/TEMPO DATA below.
  Do NOT truncate the lyrics array — every word spoken across the FULL audio track must appear in lyrics[] and transcript.
  Set `asr_confidence` to: "high" if whisper word sounds correct, "medium" if plausible but unsure,
  "low" if you had to significantly correct it or infer it from audio alone.

- tension_arc: provide one entry every 1 second (or every beat if BPM > 100). Tension rises into a chorus/drop, falls during verse/outro. Cross-check against the beat/drop timestamps provided below.
- sections: cover the entire track with no gaps. Every second must fall in exactly one section.
- emotional_peak_moments: timestamps where the music hits its hardest emotional/energy peak (typically the first chorus or drop). Maximum 5 entries.
- shot_directives: minimum 3, maximum 12 entries. Focus on the most critical edit decision moments.
- vibe_tags: 3-6 lowercase tags that describe the vibe (e.g. ["festive", "dance", "bollywood", "high_energy", "romantic"]).
- If the audio is very short (< 15s), still provide full structure based on what you can hear.
